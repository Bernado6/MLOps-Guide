# 🚀 Guide: From Jupyter Notebooks to Production-Ready ML Pipelines on AWS

## 📚 Introduction

Welcome! This guide will help you transform exploratory data science work into scalable, production-ready machine learning solutions on AWS. We'll cover:

- 📝 **Converting Jupyter notebooks into Python scripts**
- ✅ **Writing unit tests with Pytest**
- ☁️ **Exploring essential AWS services for ML workflows**

---

## 📝 Step 1: Convert Notebook to Python Scripts

### 1.1 Understand the Notebook 🔍

Before converting, ensure you:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Grasp how data is loaded, cleaned, and transformed.
- **Model Training**: Understand the algorithms and configurations used.
- **Model Evaluation**: Note the metrics and evaluation methods.
- **Dependencies**: List all external libraries and packages required.

### 1.2 Best Practices in Code Conversion 🛠️

#### Modularization 🧩

- **Functions & Classes**: Encapsulate code into reusable components.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Organize code into modules like:

  ```
  scripts/
  ├── data_preprocessing.py
  ├── model_training.py
  ├── model_inference.py
  └── utilities.py
  ```

#### Coding Standards ✨

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow Python's style guidelines.
- **Meaningful Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- **Comments & Docstrings**: Explain complex logic and document functions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks where appropriate.

### 1.3 Organize the Codebase 📁

Structure your project:

```
project_name/
├── data/
│   └── (dummy data files)
├── models/
│   └── (saved models)
├── scripts/
│   ├── train.py
│   ├── inference.py
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py
│   └── (other modules)
├── tests/
│   └── (test scripts)
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

#### Dependencies Management 📦

- Generate `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- Manually specify package versions if needed.

## ✅ Step 2: Write Unit Tests with Pytest

### 2.1 Introduction to Unit Testing 🧪

Unit testing ensures individual units of code work as intended.

### 2.2 Setting Up Pytest ⚙️

- **Install Pytest**:

  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

- **Directory Structure**: Place tests in the `tests/` folder.

### 2.3 Writing Test Cases ✍️

#### Basic Test Structure 📝

- Name test files starting with `test_`, e.g., `test_data_preprocessing.py`.

  ```python
  # tests/test_data_preprocessing.py

  import pytest
  from scripts.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data

  def test_preprocess_data():
      # Setup: Prepare dummy input data
      raw_data = ...
      # Execution: Call the function to test
      processed_data = preprocess_data(raw_data)
      # Assertion: Check if the output meets expectations
      assert processed_data == expected_output
  ```

#### Testing Edge Cases ⚠️

- Test with empty inputs, invalid data types, and extreme values.

### 2.4 Running and Interpreting Tests 🏃‍♀️

- **Run All Tests**:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- **Run Specific Tests**:

  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_file.py
  ```

- **Results Interpretation**:
  - ✅ Passed Tests
  - ❌ Failed Tests (use traceback for debugging)
